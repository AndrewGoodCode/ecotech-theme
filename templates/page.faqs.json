This leads to an overall reduction in thermal insulation value. \n\nDecork thermal cork paints Spray cork is an excellent material for reducing thermal bridging, primarily due to its thermal insulation properties. Thermal bridging occurs when heat flows across an object that is more conductive, essentially bypassing the insulation layer of a building. \n\nDecork thermal cork paint works to mitigate this issue as it can be applied to a variety of surfaces to create a continuous insulation barrier. The cork particles in the spray are naturally resistant to heat flow slowing the transfer of heat. When you apply a layer of cork on thermal bridges (like wall corners, floor slabs, and junctions), it effectively reduces the speed at which heat can transfer through those points, which in turn, minimizes thermal bridging.\n\nFurthermore, cork has a high thermal mass, allowing it to store and release heat over time, which helps in stabilizing the indoor temperature, offering a more energy-efficient solution."}},"a2647d81-02a7-41e8-9b6a-aebba0c7d414":{"type":"faq","settings":{"title":"What are the benefits of Decork products?","answer":"<li>Cork granules are a by-product of the wine cork industry, reducing waste\n<\/li><li>Thermal and acoustic insulation<\/li>\n<li>Adheres to most surfaces reducing the need for material removal\n<\/li><li>Safe for people and pets: non-toxic, 0 VOC, no off-gassing\n<\/li><li>Sustainable: Decork products are sustainably and ethically sourced\n<\/li><li>Improves indoor air quality: mould and mildew resistant and breathable\n<\/li><li>Fire and water resistant\n<\/li><li>UV fade resistant\n<\/li><li>Multiple colours to choose from<\/li>"}},"e18cb9ba-ab25-4273-b9af-abd94c67d84c":{"type":"faq","settings":{"title":"What is the best application method for Decork thermal cork paints","answer":"Decork products can be applied with a texture gun, trowel or roller"}},"ad690ed8-446e-4f13-b40d-a3a6b45a80fc":{"type":"faq","settings":{"title":"Can I use a roller to apply Decork products?","answer":"Yes!

Firstly, its high R-value comes from its cellular structure filled with air pockets, which resist heat flow, making it a potent insulator. Applying cork as an additional layer to your walls, roofs, or floors can thereby increase the R-value, helping to maintain a more consistent indoor temperature and reduce energy costs.\n\nAs for the U-value, which indicates the rate of heat loss of a material, spray cork can aid in decreasing this value, thanks to its insulative properties. A lower U-value signifies better insulation and less heat loss, which is what spray cork achieves by forming a barrier that minimizes thermal bridges and gaps where heat can escape. Thus, using Decork can optimize your building's energy efficiency by improving both its R-value and U-value."}},"4202a282-bdb8-4a6c-a008-e99713b22baf":{"type":"faq","settings":{"title":"How can I clean Decork surfaces?","answer":"Cork is highly resistant to dirt and can often be wiped off with a soft cloth or sprayed with a hose (exterior). If you are applying Decork thermal cork paint in a very high traffic area we recommend sealing the surface with Auqafloor Eco for greater resistance to dirt and scratches. Our custom kits can get you the right product for your job."}},"f2d5ee42-84d1-4826-a7e2-9871f37b0ea8":{"type":"faq","settings":{"title":"What is Decorkrete Mineral Microcement?","answer":"Decorkrete is a mineral decorative coating combining water-based resins and innovative additives \n to enable high work-ability and great aesthetic effect.
